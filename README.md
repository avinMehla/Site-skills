(Valid until March 6, 2025)
This repository contains both the frontend and backend of our project.
However, due to time constraints, we couldn't fully complete the integration.

To ensure functionality, we have added dummy data, allowing the system to work with pre-fed inputs.
We appreciate your understanding that the project is still under development, 
but despite this, it remains functional and demonstrates our intended features.
